Did this in the middle of the night when playing around with a Minecraft Mod (OpenComputers) couple months ago. Not actively learning Lua rn
(GPL v3 License) (do whatever u want)
Known Flaws: 
  Account files can be edited and are not encrypted 
  Sometimes accounts may not be detected (idk how to fix that)
